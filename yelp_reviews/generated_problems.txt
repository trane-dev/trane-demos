23 For each <business_id> predict the number of records with <text> equal to Seriously some of the best ribs I have ever had.  Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days
24 For each <business_id> predict the number of records with <text> equal to Second visit and I see what I was missing.... 

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days
25 For each <business_id> predict the number of records with <text> equal to !!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try! in next None days

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try! in next None days
798 For each <business_id> predict the total <votes_funny> in all related records with <text> not equal to Seriously some of the best ribs I have ever had.  Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days
799 For each <business_id> predict the total <votes_funny> in all related records with <text> not equal to Second visit and I see what I was missing.... 

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink.

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.

Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting!

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try! in next None days

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days
5570 For each <business_id> predict the minimum <votes_funny> in all related records with <text> equal to Second visit and I see what I was missing.... 

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink.

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days
5912 For each <business_id> predict the minimum <votes_useful> in all related records with <text> not equal to !!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try! in next None days

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink.

9090 For each <business_id> predict if there exists a record with with <text> equal to Seriously some of the best ribs I have ever had.  Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days
9091 For each <business_id> predict if there exists a record with with <text> equal to Second visit and I see what I was missing.... 

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days
9092 For each <business_id> predict if there exists a record with with <text> equal to !!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far.

The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy.

Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt. in next None days
9741 For each <business_id> predict if there exists a record with with <text> not equal to Second visit and I see what I was missing.... 

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days
9742 For each <business_id> predict if there exists a record with with <text> not equal to !!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try! in next None days

It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. 

I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) 

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days

The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. 

The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) 

The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. 

I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say "lite slaw" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. 

$10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. 

Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. in next None days
